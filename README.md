    generate_object_id**

_Then use following commands:_

**password = generate_password(length= 'your_desired_length')<br>**

**guid = generate_guid()<br>**

**credit_card_number = generate_credit_card_number(length='your_desired_length') <br>**

**pin = generate_pin_number(length='your_desired_length') <br>**

**objid = generate_object_id() <br>**
